VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_DISABLE_OPTIMIZATION_BIT             : 0x00000001 : VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_DISABLE_OPTIMIZATION_BIT specifies that the created pipeline will not be optimized. Using this flag may reduce the time taken to create the pipeline.
VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_ALLOW_DERIVATIVES_BIT                : 0x00000002 : VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_ALLOW_DERIVATIVES_BIT specifies that the pipeline to be created is allowed to be the parent of a pipeline that will be created in a subsequent call to vkCreateGraphicsPipelines or vkCreateComputePipelines.
VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_DERIVATIVE_BIT                       : 0x00000004 : VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_DERIVATIVE_BIT specifies that the pipeline to be created will be a child of a previously created parent pipeline.
VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_VIEW_INDEX_FROM_DEVICE_INDEX_BIT     : 0x00000008 : VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_VIEW_INDEX_FROM_DEVICE_INDEX_BIT specifies that any shader input variables decorated as ViewIndex will be assigned values as if they were decorated as DeviceIndex.
VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_DISPATCH_BASE                        : 0x00000010 : VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_DISPATCH_BASE specifies that a compute pipeline can be used with vkCmdDispatchBase with a non-zero base workgroup.
