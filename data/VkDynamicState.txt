VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_VIEWPORT : 0 : VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_VIEWPORT specifies that the pViewports state in VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo will be ignored and must be set dynamically with vkCmdSetViewport before any draw commands. The number of viewports used by a pipeline is still specified by the viewportCount member of VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo.
VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_SCISSOR : 1 : VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_SCISSOR specifies that the pScissors state in VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo will be ignored and must be set dynamically with vkCmdSetScissor before any draw commands. The number of scissor rectangles used by a pipeline is still specified by the scissorCount member of VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo.
VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_LINE_WIDTH : 2 : VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_LINE_WIDTH specifies that the lineWidth state in VkPipelineRasterizationStateCreateInfo will be ignored and must be set dynamically with vkCmdSetLineWidth before any draw commands that generate line primitives for the rasterizer.
VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_DEPTH_BIAS : 3 : VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_DEPTH_BIAS specifies that the depthBiasConstantFactor, depthBiasClamp and depthBiasSlopeFactor states in VkPipelineRasterizationStateCreateInfo will be ignored and must be set dynamically with vkCmdSetDepthBias before any draws are performed with depthBiasEnable in VkPipelineRasterizationStateCreateInfo set to {@code true}.
VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_BLEND_CONSTANTS : 4 : VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_BLEND_CONSTANTS specifies that the blendConstants state in VkPipelineColorBlendStateCreateInfo will be ignored and must be set dynamically with vkCmdSetBlendConstants before any draws are performed with a pipeline state with VkPipelineColorBlendAttachmentState member blendEnable set to {@code true} and any of the blend functions using a constant blend color.
VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_DEPTH_BOUNDS : 5 : VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_DEPTH_BOUNDS specifies that the minDepthBounds and maxDepthBounds states of VkPipelineDepthStencilStateCreateInfo will be ignored and must be set dynamically with vkCmdSetDepthBounds before any draws are performed with a pipeline state with VkPipelineDepthStencilStateCreateInfo member depthBoundsTestEnable set to {@code true}.
VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_STENCIL_COMPARE_MASK : 6 : VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_STENCIL_COMPARE_MASK specifies that the compareMask state in VkPipelineDepthStencilStateCreateInfo for both front and back will be ignored and must be set dynamically with vkCmdSetStencilCompareMask before any draws are performed with a pipeline state with VkPipelineDepthStencilStateCreateInfo member stencilTestEnable set to {@code true}.
VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_STENCIL_WRITE_MASK : 7 : VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_STENCIL_WRITE_MASK specifies that the writeMask state in VkPipelineDepthStencilStateCreateInfo for both front and back will be ignored and must be set dynamically with vkCmdSetStencilWriteMask before any draws are performed with a pipeline state with VkPipelineDepthStencilStateCreateInfo member stencilTestEnable set to {@code true}.
VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_STENCIL_REFERENCE : 8 : VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_STENCIL_REFERENCE specifies that the reference state in VkPipelineDepthStencilStateCreateInfo for both front and back will be ignored and must be set dynamically with vkCmdSetStencilReference before any draws are performed with a pipeline state with VkPipelineDepthStencilStateCreateInfo member stencilTestEnable set to {@code true}.
