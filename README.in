## Background

The `jcoronado` package provides a very thin layer over the [Vulkan](https://www.vulkan.org/)
API that intends to provide some degree of memory and type safety. The intention
of the package is to make Vulkan feel like a Java API, without sacrificing
performance. Internally, the package uses the excellent [LWJGL3](https://www.lwjgl.org/)
Vulkan bindings, and adds a thin layer of immutable types and interfaces.

## Features

* Type-safe [Vulkan](https://www.vulkan.org/) frontend
* Strong separation of API and implementation to allow for switching to different bindings at compile-time
* Extensive use of `try-with-resources` to prevent resource leaks
* Strongly-typed interfaces with a heavy emphasis on immutable value types
* Type-safe extension mechanism
* Fully documented (JavaDoc)
* Example code included
* [OSGi](https://www.osgi.org/) ready.
* [JPMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform_Module_System) ready.
* ISC license

## Requirements

The `jcoronado` package currently targets Vulkan 1.3 and up. It requires the
`synchronization2` feature to be available and enabled. According to the
[Vulkan hardware database](https://vulkan.gpuinfo.org/), this currently
covers around `99.82%` of hardware.

## Building

Install a Vulkan SDK. On Linux, there will be almost certainly be distribution
packages available with names such as `vulkan-validationlayers`, `vulkan-tools`,
etc. On Windows, install the [LunarG SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/). On
Windows, ensure that you have the right vendor drivers installed for your
graphics card; if you don't do this, the library (and the test suite) will
raise exceptions with messages such as "Missing `vulkan-1.dll`".

Then run:

```
$ mvn clean package
```

If this step fails, it's a bug. Please report it!
